Brief description of the animation achieved: 

My animation starts with a input dialogue boxes which ask the user to enter their name and then asks the user if they like gardening. 
It responds with messages derived from the user inputs.

It then presents an outdoor scene with sky, grass and soil. The sun passes repeatedly across the sky and the shade of the sky changes as it does so. 

There is a tap with a red faucet which can be turned on by left-clicking in that area with the mouse. This makes water spray onto the soil which causes a plant to grow. 
The plant reaches a certain height and then stops. At any stage the plant can be "harvested" by hovering the mouse over the base of the plant. 
A shears is then portrayed at the cursor and left-clicking will harvest the plant. 

There are two text messages which appear on the screen instructing the user to turn on the tap with the mouse, and then to "harvest" the plant when it is fully grown. 



Known bugs/problems: 

There is a small green dot on the grass before the plant begins to grow. 
This is caused by the line being a single pixel long. I don't see it as a major issue as it could represent the sprout of the plant. 

When the user is asked to reply to a question with yes or no, in actual fact they can enter any word beginning with either y or n. I found this acceptable as it
allows for numerous slang / local versions of the repsonce eg "yeah" or "na".
